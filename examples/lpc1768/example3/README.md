# Slack Stealing example 3
Example project that uses a *Rate Monotonic* scheduler with *Slack Stealing*. Each task prints the slack counters for all tasks and the system available slack. The available slack is used to schedule an aperiodic task, which is ready to run at random times.



Same as example 2, but it uses the Tracealizer library in order to generate a trace of the system execution.
